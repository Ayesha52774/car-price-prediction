# car-price-prediction
A simple Machine Learning project to predict car prices using Python and Linear Regression.
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project uses a simple Linear Regression model to predict the selling price of a car based on features like brand, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.

## 📁 Files Included:
- `car_data.csv` - The dataset used
- `car_price_prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step model building
- `README.md` - Project overview

## 🔧 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 💡 How It Works
1. Loads and preprocesses the dataset
2. Converts categorical columns to numeric (One-Hot Encoding)
3. Builds a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluates the model performance
5. Predicts price for a new car input

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the CSV and notebook to Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Try custom predictions using your own car data
